curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Or follow installation instructions from [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

## Setup Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use Python virtual environment, so you don't pollute your system Python environment.

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

```bash
# Update/upgrade dependencies
poetry update
```

```bash
# Activate Python virtual environment
poetry shell
```

## Environment Variables
Copy an existing environment template file and fill in all the necessary values:
```bash
# Create .env file (by copying from .env.example)
cp .env.example .env
```

### Start the server (locally)

```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

### Check style

Run the following command at the root of `backend` directory
`black .`
`isort .`
